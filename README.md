# Ollie-Lloyds-Portfolio

This document is Ollie Lloyds web dev portfolio.
This project is designed to outline Ollie Lloyd's portfolio of github and other web dev projects.

The most challenging part of this challenge was how to style the CSS, writing the HTML and linking very basic CSS worked well but had a bit of trouble really making the site not look clunky. A tutor helped me really refine the acceptance criteria and neaten up the appearance. The second most challenging aspect of this challenge was how to implement the media query for different sized screens, I know how to make changes when the browser is smaller but wasn't sure what I should do to optimize its appearance.
I also had trouble being able to make an image clickable and styling that image so I made a box with a text box that was clickable.

## Acceptance Criteria is as follows
    ```
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
    ``` 

The link displays an about me section, a picture of me, my resume, how to contact me and all of my existing repos -
